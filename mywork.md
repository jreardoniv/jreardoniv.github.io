My career has encompassed various industries and roles. Below are a few examples of projects I have completed in different professional settings.

Revenue Recovery Initiative

During my tenure, I observed a critical discrepancy in the information flow between the finance and project management teams. This inconsistency in data across different software systems and reporting mechanisms was causing significant financial discrepancies.

To address this issue, I took the following steps:

1. Conducted a thorough complex data analysis using such softwares such as excel, tableau, and pandas to identify the root cause of the discrepancies.
2. Updated and standardized data sheets to ensure uniformity in information.
3. Revised reporting processes to enhance accuracy and consistency across departments.


As a result of these actions, the organization successfully recovered $700K in outstanding revenue, significantly improving our financial health and operational efficiency.

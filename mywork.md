<p style="font-size: 18px;">During my tenure, I observed a critical discrepancy in the information flow between the finance and project management teams. This inconsistency in data across different software systems and reporting mechanisms was causing significant financial discrepancies.</p>

  <li>Conducted thorough data analysis using Excel, Tableau, and Pandas.</li>
  <li>Standardized data sheets for uniformity.</li>
  <li>Revised reporting processes to enhance accuracy and consistency across departments.</li>

My career has encompassed various industries and roles. Below are a few examples of projects I have completed in different professional settings.

<h3 class="archive__subtitle">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].recent_posts | default: "Addressing Financial Discrepancies"}}</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">During my tenure, I observed a critical discrepancy in the information flow between the finance and project management teams. This inconsistency in data across different software systems and reporting mechanisms was causing significant financial discrepancies.</p>

<b>Steps Taken:</b>

<ol style="font-size: 18px;">
  <li>Conducted thorough data analysis using Excel, Tableau, and Pandas.</li>
  <li>Standardized data sheets for uniformity.</li>
  <li>Revised reporting processes to enhance accuracy and consistency across departments.</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>As a result of these actions, the organization successfully recovered $700K in outstanding revenue, significantly improving our financial health and operational efficiency.</strong></p>

<h3 class="archive__subtitle">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].recent_posts | default: "Collaborative Team Project"}}</h3>Collaborative Team Project

<p style="font-size: 18px;">I played a pivotal role in the integration of new operations software within our organization. Collaborating closely with a team of 20-30 associates, which included operational and quality directors, management, and IT specialists, I spearheaded the definition and implementation of new processes.</p> 

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>This collaborative effort led to significant improvements across multiple areas:</b></p>

<ol style="font-size: 18px;">
  <li><strong>Production:</strong> Enhanced efficiency and throughput, resulting in higher output and reduced bottlenecks.</li>
  <li><strong>Incident Reporting and Resolution:</strong> Streamlined procedures that allowed for quicker identification and resolution of issues, minimizing downtime and improving overall operational stability.</li>
  <li><strong>Interdepartmental Communication:</strong> Fostered better communication channels between departments, ensuring that information flowed seamlessly and that all stakeholders were aligned and informed.</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>These efforts collectively contributed to a more robust and efficient operational framework, driving both productivity and quality to new heights.</strong></p>

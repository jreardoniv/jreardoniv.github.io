My areas of expertise include Systems & Networking Security, Cloud Security, Cyber-Incident Response, Cyber Defense, Risk Management, and Vulnerability Management, among others. My technical proficiencies span Python, VS Code Studio, SIEM Software, SQL, Linux, Mac, Windows, SAP, Agile, and more. Passionate about continuous learning, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance from Western Governors University and hold numerous certifications, including CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+), CompTIA PenTest+, and ISC2 System Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP). My professional experience includes freelance work for Memeotech, roles at Personalis and Pacific Biosciences, and leading teams at Adecco @ Google.
